                    <p>A new study conducted by the American Ministry of Magic exploring the relationship of a state's Mugglality rate, age, & income, with Every Flavour Bean consumption, butter beer consumption, and healthcare access. </p>

                    <p>The study shows that states with a higher number of Muggles have increased rates of both butter beer consumption, and Every Flavour Bean consumption. Higher Muggality rates are also associatied with less access to healthcare. "They're
                        just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways," says Pure-Blood supremist Draco Malfoy. "They don't know how to take care of themselves."</p>

                    <p>The study also shows similar relationships with a state's median income and age. "Muggles are by nature younger than Pure-Bloods. Consumption rates are no different between young Muggles and young Pure & Half Bloods." says former Pure-Blood
